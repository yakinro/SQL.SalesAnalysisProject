# SQL.SalesAnalysisProject

Completed this project utilizing the power of SQL by performing data extraction, transformation, and analysis on a complex sales database. I used JOIN operations to combine data, creating a comprehensive view of the sales process. Additionally, I utilized aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to calculate metrics such as total sales,top-selling products, average order value, quarterly sales, and products often sold/bought together. This project helped my skills in data retrieval, table relationships, and statistical analysis, enabling me to generate insightful reports for decision-makers.
